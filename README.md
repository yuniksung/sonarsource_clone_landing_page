# SonarSource Cloned Website
This is a cloned website from `sonarsource.com`.

This page is not deployed.

## Technology used
- HTML
- SASS

## Accomplished
### Responsiveness (mobile friendly)

Media-query has been added to: 
- 320px ~ 375px: Small to medium mobile screen size
- 768px : Tablet screen size
- 1024px : Laptop screen size 

- Changed bootstrap to SASS.
The website has used Bootstrap for styling but I needed to change it to SASS to be able to add smooth responsiveness.

- HTML structure has been modified
To make easy and smooth responsiveness, I've restructured elements.
