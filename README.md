Deployed Application: https://yuniksung.github.io/sonarsource_clone_landing_page/
Github Repository: https://github.com/yuniksung/sonarsource_clone_landing_page

## Technology used
- HTML
- SASS

## Accomplished
#### Responsiveness (mobile friendly)

Media-query has been added to: 
- 320px ~ 375px: Small to medium mobile screen size
- 768px : Tablet screen size
- 1024px : Laptop screen size 

Styling language has been changed:
- Changed bootstrap to SASS.
The website has used Bootstrap for styling but I needed to change it to SASS to be able to add smooth responsiveness.

Other things:
- HTML structure has been modified
To make easy and smooth responsiveness, I've restructured elements.
